"""law_tasks: Distributed training orchestration for NEEDLE.

This package defines the complete task DAG for training ensemble models with
systematic variations and cross-validation folds using law.

Task Hierarchy:
    MainTask (entry point)
    └── EstimatorTask (one per estimator)
         └── SystematicTask (one per systematic variation)
              └── EnsembleTask (one per ensemble group)
                   └── FoldTask (actual training with PyTorch Lightning)

Supporting Components:
    - SnapshotTask: Collects trained models into a snapshot for evaluation
    - DownstreamTask: Runs post-training analysis and evaluation tasks
    - Mixins: HydraMixin for configuration, CollectOutputMixin for debugging
    - Workflows: Support for local, HTCondor, and SLURM execution

Features:
- Multi-level aggregation: folds → ensembles → systematics → estimators
- Remote job dispatch to HPC clusters (FoldTask only)
- Automatic result aggregation and checkpoint collection
- Workflow visualization and debugging
- Configuration composition with Hydra

Usage:
    law run MainTask --config-file path/to/config.yaml
    law run DownstreamTask --downstream my_analysis_task --config-file path/to/config.yaml

See documentation for detailed configuration and usage examples.
